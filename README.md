Initial Steps
-------------

This class is based on the standard `book` class of LaTeX, so it accept structure given by *part*s, *chapter*s, *section*s, *subsection*s, *paragraph*s and *subparagraph*s.

This class was born in the physics department, so it loads many mathematical packages, such as:

- `amsmath`
- `amstext`
- `amsfonts`
- `amssymb`
- `amsthm`
- `mathrsfs`
- `dsfont`
- `stmaryrd`
